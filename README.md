# 🛠️ Roadmap to Build the Tool & the updates. 

⚠️ Warning: This tool is under active development.
The following is a list of planned updates and improvements.
Feel free to contribute by implementing any feature from the list!

## ✅ Phase 1: Offline Cracking Basics
1) Basic Brute Force (Alphabets only, fixed length)
2) Dictionary Attack (from file)
3) Hash Comparison (MD5/SHA1/SHA256 using OpenSSL or own implementation)

## 🔜 Phase 2: Advanced Offline Cracking
1) Hybrid Attack (Append/prepend numbers to words)
2) Rainbow Table Lookup (build and search simple rainbow tables)
3) Rule-based Attacks (basic rules like capitalization, 1337 speak)

💡Add Hash Formats: bcrypt, NTLM

## 🔜 Phase 3: Online Cracking Engine
1) Basic HTTP Login Brute Force (test dummy web server locally)
2) Credential Stuffing with Proxy Support
3) FTP/SSH Brute Force using libraries like libssh or raw sockets
4) Password Spraying Logic
5) Phishing Simulation with Key Capture
