🛠️ Roadmap to Build the Tool (Step-by-Step)
✅ Phase 1: Offline Cracking Basics
Basic Brute Force (Alphabets only, fixed length)

Dictionary Attack (from file)

Hash Comparison (MD5/SHA1/SHA256 using OpenSSL or own implementation)

🔜 Phase 2: Advanced Offline Cracking
Hybrid Attack (Append/prepend numbers to words)

Rainbow Table Lookup (build and search simple rainbow tables)

Rule-based Attacks (basic rules like capitalization, 1337 speak)

Add Hash Formats: bcrypt, NTLM

🔜 Phase 3: Online Cracking Engine
Basic HTTP Login Brute Force (test dummy web server locally)

Credential Stuffing with Proxy Support

FTP/SSH Brute Force using libraries like libssh or raw sockets

Password Spraying Logic

Phishing Simulation with Key Capture
